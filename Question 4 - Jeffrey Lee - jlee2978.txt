Limitations of Unity:

1.
-There is no easy way to share on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
-To overcome this, we have to manually write scripts to share it on these platforms

2.
-Unity does not have a debugger
-The only way to overcome this is to debug using an external resource such as Visual Studio

3.
-Complex 3D objects are difficult to make in Unity
-We will have to use an external resource such as Inventor
