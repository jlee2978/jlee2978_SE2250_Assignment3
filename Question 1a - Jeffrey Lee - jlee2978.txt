Mistakes:

1. 
-`CardProspector.OnMouseUpAsButton()' cannot override inherited member `Card.OnMouseUpAsButton()' because it is not marked virtual, abstract or override
 in Card.cs
-So, we need to change 'public void OnMouseUpAsButton(){' to 'public virtual void OnMouseUpAsButton(){'

2.
-There are only 13 possible card types, not 14
-So in the MakeCards() method of Deck.cs, we have to change 'for (int i=0; i<14; i++) {' to 'for (int i=0; i<13; i++) {'

3.
-Many properties in ScoreManager.cs were missing a 'S.' in fron of them, such as score and chain throughout the script
-Adding the 'S.' allows properties such as the score to be properly shown
-Something similar occurred in Prospector.cs where I had to add "ScoreManager.S." in front of variables such as score
