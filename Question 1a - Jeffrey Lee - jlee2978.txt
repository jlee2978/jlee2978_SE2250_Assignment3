Mistakes:

1. 
-`CardProspector.OnMouseUpAsButton()' cannot override inherited member `Card.OnMouseUpAsButton()' because it is not marked virtual, abstract or override
 in Card.cs
-So, we need to change 'public void OnMouseUpAsButton(){' to 'public virtual void OnMouseUpAsButton(){'

2.
-In Prospector.cs : 9, the original code was trying to create a MonoBehaviour using the 'new' keyword. Classes that inherit from MonoBehaviour, such as ScoreManager, cannot be instantiated with the 'new' keyword
-So, we need to change 'private ScoreManager SM = new ScoreManager();' to 'private ScoreManager SM;'

3.
-There are only 13 possible card types, not 14, so in the MakeCards() method of Deck.cs, we have to change 'for (int i=0; i<14; i++) {' to 'for (int i=0; i<13; i++) {'
